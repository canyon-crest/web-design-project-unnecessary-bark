<h3>Drums:</h3><p><img src="images/tama-imperialstar.jpg" alt="Tama Imperialstar" width=250px class="main-images"/> I first started playing the drums because one of my mom’s close friends invited me and mom over to dinner with her and her family. One of her son’s, Anthony, was about 6 years older than me and after we ate, he showed me around his electronic drum set and showed me how fast he could use the double kick that he had on his drum set. A double pedal is a second pedal right next to the pedal that closes the hi-hat that connects to an axle that connects to a batter in front of the kick pedal so along with the other standard pedal for the kick drum, you could play very fast. It’s typically just for heavy metal but he had one just for fun. I found it very interesting and fascinating but I didn’t really think about it again. A few weeks later, my mom asked me about what instrument I wanted to play and I said the drums and she got me into lessons. Not immediately though, we both forgot about it for a year or two. But once I got into it, it was a ton of fun. My favorite music artist is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Impala" target="_blank">Tame Impala</a> so I learned how to play two of his songs on the drums, Reality in Motion, and Music To Walk Home By. Next semester I’m taking rock band so I can play the drums for school!</p>

<h3>Lord:</h3><p><img src="images/bible.jpg" alt="Bible" width=250px class="main-images"/> By far the one thing that I am so glad that I have in my life is a relationship with the Lord. He had led me through the darkest of times and replaced the father figure in my life my father could never be. I have learned so much from Him and I think I am such a better person, more patient, more understanding, more compassionate, less stressed, etc. because of Him and from studying <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JHN.1.NIV" target="_blank">His word</a>. I know that with a relationship with Him, I have nothing to fear in this life because nothing is greater than Him and nothing else will pass into the afterlife other than my relationship with Him. When I was going through anxiety and so much stress with my dad, He was always there even when no one else was. Even if I end up homeless, get some horrible cancer, or I become an orphan, something horrible like that, as long as I still have my relationship with the Lord, it doesn’t matter, I will still find happiness. The only light in my life that will always be there is Him. I got baptized about 2 or so years ago and I’ve been happy in His presence and in His love ever since.</p>

<h3>Video Games:</h3><p><img src="images/hunt-showdown-title.jpg" alt="Hunt: Showdown 1896" width=250px class="main-images"/> The thing that I do most in my free time is play video games with my friends. When I first started playing video games, it was Fortnite on mobile, then on ps4, then on ps5, and since about the beginning of the year I’ve been playing exclusively a first-person extraction shooter called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt:_Showdown" target="_blank">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a> on ps5. I’ve been playing video games for about 7 years now and it’s been my favorite hobby ever since. Right now in Hunt Showdown there’s an event that pretty much just started called Web of the Empress. There’s new weapons and there’s these things called tarot cards that give you special powerups and stuff such as decreasing the spread of weapons which is really good for hipfire and such. Most of the friends I play with are online and I have to filter through a lot of people to find some good people because a lot of them are older than me or are stoners and such but there are some good, nice, and honest people out there and playing with those people is the other half of why I play video games, to spend time with friends.</p>
